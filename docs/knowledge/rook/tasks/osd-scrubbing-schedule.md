title: "OSD: Configure Scrubbing Schedule"
---

Currently you need to add your Ceph OSD scrubbing schedule config options to the [`rook-config-override` ConfigMap of your Rook Ceph cluster](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.11/Storage-Configuration/Advanced/ceph-configuration/#custom-cephconf-settings).

For more information on OSD Scrubbing and scheduling, see [Ceph OSD Scrubbing](../../ceph/osds/scrubbing.md).
