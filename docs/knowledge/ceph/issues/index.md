## CephFS mount issues on Hosts

Make sure you have a (active) Linux kernel of version `4.17` or higher.

!!! tip
    In general it is recommended to have a very up-to-date version of the Linux kernel, as many improvements have been made to the Ceph kernel drivers in newer kernel versions (`5.x` or higher).
