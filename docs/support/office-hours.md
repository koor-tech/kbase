# Koor Office Hours

## On Demand

The Koor team is available to answer any questions you have about Rook and Ceph, really any topic related to data storage. We would love to get to know you and learn about your data storage situation.

The Koor team will hold office hours based on demand. Use our [contact form](https://about.koor.tech/contact/) to let us know that you would like to talk.

## Recordings

For a while, we held office hours at a scheduled time every couple of weeks. Although we never had any visitors, we kept ourselves entertained by talking about data storage. What else?

The recordings from these sessions are available on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDCSyApxNCP7fTIiQ8uQ2Bg). Hours of fun.
