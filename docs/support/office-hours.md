# Koor Office Hours

## On Demand

The Koor team is available to answer any questions you have about Rook, Ceph, and everything we have to offer - the Koor Data Control Center, Koor Storage Distribution, Koor Operator, etc. We would also love to learn more about you and your data storage situation.

The Koor team has open office hours based on customer demand. We are happy to meet with anyone&mdash;customer or not&mdash;to discuss data storage. Use our [contact form](https://try.koor.tech/contact/) to leave us a note, and we will arrange a time to talk.
