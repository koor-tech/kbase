# Koor Office Hours

## Join Us

Koor offers free office hours every other Wednesday at 10 AM Pacific.

The Koor team is available to answer any questions you have about Rook, Ceph, and the Koor Storage Distribution. We would also love to learn more about you and your data storage situation.

Plus, we record our sessions for the benefit of all. You could be famous. But only if you want to...
