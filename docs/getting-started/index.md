Welcome to the Getting Started Guide!, we are excited that you have chosen Koor Storage Distribution (KSD) as 
your Kubernetes storage solution.

We understand that there may be many unfamiliar terms for you, 
or perhaps you simply want to ensure that KSD is the solution you've been searching for. 
In this guide, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of using KSD, starting from scratch.

Here's a summary of the guide's index:

- **[Introduction to Kubernetes](kubernetes.md)**: While you may already be familiar with Kubernetes, we want to ensure that everyone is on the same page. This section will cover the basic concepts, providing a clear understanding before diving deeper.

- **[Containers and Persistent Storage](containers-and-persistent-storage.md)**: Containers are an incredible solution for deploying applications. However, they are inherently transient, resulting in data loss when a container terminates. In this section, we will explore how to leverage storage with Kubernetes.

- **[Storage Solutions](solutions-for-storage.md)**: We will present the available options for storage, providing a simple comparison among them. This will help you make an informed decision based on your specific requirements.

- **[Introduction to Ceph](introduction-to-ceph.md)**: Here, we will introduce Ceph and explain why it should be considered as a storage solution. You will also become familiar with essential Ceph terms, such as the CRUSH algorithm.

- **[Installing and Using Rook](introduction-to-rook.md)**: In this section, we will familiarize you with the fundamental terms related to Rook. Understanding these terms will enable you to effectively utilize Rook within your storage infrastructure

- **[KSD Koor Storage Distribution](ksd-koor-storage-distribution.md)**: Koor has tools that improve the Rook-Ceph experience, we developed features based on our customers and the communities pain points, to make storage easier to run and consume than ever.

We hope this guide helps you successfully utilize Koor Storage Distribution.
