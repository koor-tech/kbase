title: Data Storage Guides
---

We want to help you understand you data storage options, especially Ceph and Rook. This set of guides starts with a high-level overview of [storage solutions](solutions-for-storage.md) in the market. Then you can learn about [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md), [containers and persistent storage](containers-and-persistent-storage.md).

You can also get an introduction to [Ceph](introduction-to-ceph.md) and [Rook](introduction-to-rook.md).

Finally, if you happen to be using the Data Control Center, you might find the [getting started guide](getting-started-data-control-center.md) to be useful.
