title: Getting Started with your Koor Starter Cluster
---

# Overview

Thank you for trying Rook Ceph using a Koor Starter Cluster. The Starter Cluster is running Kubernetes on 4? nodes.

Your starter cluster run in a low-cost cloud provider. We provision shared, virtual machines by the month, which keeps the cost as low as they come. You get 4 nodes with X processors, Y RAM, Z GB of local storage. The data storage cluster starts at 4 nodes (because it is designed for production) and has NNN GB of usable space.

We figure that is good enough when you are just trying to see how everything works. Frankly, that's pretty good for your first production Kubernetes cluster with Ceph storage.

Also, that means there is a lot of room to scale up and get better performance in many dimensions. When you are ready to graduate to a more substantial system, talk to us about [Managed Ceph](https://koor.tech/solutions/managed-ceph). We can provision dedicated hardware in the same low-cost cloud, get everything set up for what you want to do, and run it all for you for as long as you like.

We are also happy to turn over the keys if and when you are ready to take over. After all, it's your cluster with your data and applications.

# How to take control

## Log in

## View console (??)

## See what is running

# Do something with it

## Use case recipes to try

-   AI w/ S3 (object storage)
-   _SOMETHING_ w/ block storage
-   CephFS storage
